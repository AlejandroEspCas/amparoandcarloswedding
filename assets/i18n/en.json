    "DESCRIPTION": "It was in December 2014 when we exchanged a 'nice to meet you,' and in August 2017 our paths crossed again. After a very patriotic date on September 16th, the weekends became ours, and we became inseparable. It didn't take long for us to love each other unconditionally and become a family together with our daughter Sofía. 8 years later, after so many adventures and good times, we are pleased to invite you to the celebration of our love."
